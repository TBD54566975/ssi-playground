# SSI Playground

The SSI Playground is meant to help orient new faces into the SSI ecosystem. 

## Introduction

It relies on the [SSI Service](https://github.com/TBD54566975/ssi-service), so make sure to get that project pulled down and running locally. 

Use `npm run start` to start running the playground locally. 

Orient users to the project here. This is a good place to start with an assumption
that the user knows very little - so start with the Big Picture and show how this
project fits into it. It may be good to reference/link the broader architecture in the
`collaboration` repo or the developer site here.

Then maybe a dive into what this project does.

Diagrams and other visuals are helpful here. Perhaps code snippets showing usage.

Project leads should complete, alongside this `README`:
* [CODEOWNERS](./CODEOWNERS) - set project lead(s)
* [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) - Fill out how to: install prereqs, build, test, run, access CI, chat, discuss, file issues

The other files in this template repo may be used as-is:
* [CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)
* [GOVERNANCE.md](./GOVERNANCE.md)
* [LICENSE](./LICENSE)
